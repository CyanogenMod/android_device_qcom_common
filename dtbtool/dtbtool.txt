3) Operations
-------------
3.1) Build-time:
  1) Each DTS per device will add a "qcom,msm-id" entry
     e.g. for msm8974-sim.dts, add
            qcom,msm-id = <x y z>;
          or
            qcom,msm-id = <x z>;
            qcom,board-id = <y y'>;
     x  = ID for msm8974
     y  = ID for CDP, MTP, etc.
     y' = ID for subtype (assumed zero if absent)
     z  = ID for soc revision
     The entry can optionally be an array:
         qcom,msm-id = <x1 y1 z1>, <x2 y2 z2>, ...;
       or
         qcom,msm-id = <x1 z1>, <x2 z2>, ...;
         qcom,board-id = <y1 y1'>, ...;
     Note that qcom,msm-id and qcom,board-id are not matched
     pairs.
  2) Kernel compile will generate the DTB
  3) Android build will run a new tool (dtbTool)
     a) scan the DTB output directory for all compiled DTB
     b) decompile the DTB for "qcom,msm-id"/"qcom,board-id"
     c) generate the QC table of device tree in sorted
        order (platform, variant, subtype, soc rev)
     d) modified mkbootimg will merge new table of DT

3.2) Run-time:
  1) LK bootloader will obtain MSM id/variant/subtype/soc rev
     info either from early bootloaders or via other means
  2) LK bootloader will check entries #10 for non-zero
     value (set to zero for standard boot.img).  If the
     value is non-zero, refer to page section after
     the "second stage" in the boot.img layout
  3) Check QCDT magic
  4) Check QCDT version (optional LK to handle multiple
     QCDT version)
  5) LK scans through the QCDT table to look for matching
     entry.  Search order is:
     1) platform ID exact match
     2) variant ID exact match
     3) subtype ID exact match
     4) select the highest soc rev in QCDT that is
        equal to or lower than the runtime detected soc rev
  6) Load the matching DTB blob to the tags addr
  7) LK pass the correct DTB to the kernel
